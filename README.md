# Obsidian Style Text

Apply custom CSS styles to selected text in your Obsidian Notes.


## Instructions

The Style Text Obsidian plugin allows to create as many CSS Styles as you wish:

![Alt text](./assets/image-styles.png)

Then, they will be available to be applied to the selected text in the editor via **Commands** (Command Palette):

![Alt text](./assets/command-palette.png)

Each command can optionally be assigned to Obsidian Hotkeys for quick access:

The styles are also available in contextual menu in the editor. You first need to enable them in the plugin settings:

![Alt text](./assets/enable-contextual-menu.png)

So the enable styles will be available in the context-menu to be applied to the selected text after right-clicking:
![Alt text](./assets/context-menu.png)

To get the pretended result:
![Alt text](./assets/pretended-result.png)


The plugin also offers an aditional command "Remove Style" to get rid of the unwanted styles. You only need to select the paragraph, or text or place the cursor in front of a style text and choose the command from the context menu or command palette:

![Alt text](./assets/remove-style.png)

The order of the context menu items follows the order in the settings. You can move up or down the styles as desired:

![Alt text](./assets/styles-order.png)
